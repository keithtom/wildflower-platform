# README

The definition folder contains the models that represent the "template" of all workflows.

Processes are top-level concepts.  We start by defining a library of potential processes, each with many steps.

Workflows are also top-level concepts.  A workflow adds selected processes to itself, and maintains the dependencies between the processes and steps (a.k.a 'workables').

An author user can define many workflows or versions of workflows built up of the same building blocks of processes and dependencies.
