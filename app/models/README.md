# Models

## Primary Models

These models are the ones that will likely be reused across the entire platform.
For example, the SSJ is one sub-application of the entire WF platform.  SSJ specific models belong in the SSJ namespace.  But people and schools will be used across the SSJ, advice process, directory etc.

## Why Person class and not TeacherLeader class?
I specifically chose Person over something more specific like TeacherLeader because ETLs become TLs become Operations Guides and become Foundation Partners.  So people speak of them as separate groups but they really are roles that people hold.
