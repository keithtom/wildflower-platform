Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,
<% else %>
Hello!
<% end %> 

We are thrilled to welcome you to join <%= ENV['APP_NAME'] %>!

Through <%= ENV['APP_NAME'] %>, you will have immediate access to the Wildflower People Directory.  This is an interactive tool for you to see who is in the network, what schools are in the network and a way for you to connect with them and for others to connect with you.

We will also be using the Wildflower Directory as our way of knowing who is in the Wildflower network and using the information within the Directory to share communications and information (such as information about the Wildflower Gathering, Affinity Group Spaces, etc.!). 

We have big plans and hopes for the development of this tool - including simplifying access to highly requested resources (e.g., where is that operations template again? Where's the digest from last week?), a simplified advice tool, reminders for upcoming due dates and more!  Stick with us as this resource gets further developed.

For the moment, please visit this URL: <%= @invite_url %> to log in and check it out!

Welcome to the next stage in Wildflower connection!
Katelyn & Cam
