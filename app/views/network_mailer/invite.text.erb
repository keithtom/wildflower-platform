Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,
<% else %>
Hello!
<% end %> 

We are thrilled to welcome you to join the Wildflower Platform!

Through the Wildflower Platform, you will have immediate access to a people directory.  This is an interactive tool for you to see who is in the network, what schools are in the network and a way for you to connect with them and for others to connect with you.

We have big plans and hopes for the development of this tool - including simplifying access to highly requested resources (e.g., where is that operations template again? Where's the digest from last week?), a simplified advice tool, reminders for upcoming due dates and more!  Stick with us as this resource gets further developed.

For the moment, please visit this URL: <%= @invite_url %> to log in and check it out!

Welcome to the next stage in Wildflower connection!
Cam & Katelyn
