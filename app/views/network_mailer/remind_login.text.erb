Dear Teacher Leaders,

We hope this finds you well, warm and headed into a restful holiday break.

We are planning the next phase for the <%= ENV['APP_NAME'] %> - your one stop shop for everything you need to do for your school, tailored for Wildflower teacher leaders who are guiding and managing administrative tasks for your school.

To that end, we have two 5 min requests of you:
  1. Please log in at this url <%= @invite_url %> and vote for what feature you'd like to see us build next!
  2. If you haven't yet, please update your information in the Wildflower Directory - click 'network' on the left hand side to log into both your personal and school profiles.

  We are looking forward to building great things with and for you in 2024!

Warmly,
Cam & Katelyn
