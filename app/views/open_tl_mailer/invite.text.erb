As dedicated leaders in the Wildflower community, your commitment to fostering a nurturing and effective learning environment is truly inspiring. To support your ongoing efforts, we are excited to introduce a new feature on the My Wildflower platform: the Interactive Monthly Administrative Checklist.

What is the Interactive Monthly Administrative Checklist?

The Interactive Monthly Administrative Checklist is a dynamic tool designed to help you efficiently manage your administrative tasks. This feature provides a comprehensive, easy-to-use checklist that updates monthly, ensuring you stay on top of your responsibilities throughout the academic year. 

Key Benefits

1. Streamlined Task Management: Easily track your to-do list with a clear, organized layout that prioritizes your administrative duties.
2. Monthly Updates: Receive timely updates and reminders tailored to the specific needs of each month, keeping you ahead of schedule.
3. Collaboration: Mark tasks as completed and assign team members to different tasks to promote collaboration and ensure everyone is aligned on key administrative tasks.

How to Access

When you sign in (https://my.wildflowerschools.org/login), you will see the option to go to “checklists” on the left hand side. From there you will see a list of tasks and milestones that match the monthly admin checklists. We encourage you to take a look, explore around and start assigning yourself and your partner tasks to track your monthly to-do list!

Office Hours and Support

We will be hosting office hours and an evening session over the next few weeks focusing on learning how to use the new Admin checklists. Please join if you can!
