</p>
<p>
As dedicated leaders in the Wildflower community, your commitment to fostering a nurturing and effective learning 
environment is truly inspiring. To support your ongoing efforts, we are excited to introduce a new feature on the 
My Wildflower platform: the Interactive Monthly Administrative Checklist.
</p>
<p>
<b>What is the Interactive Monthly Administrative Checklist?</b>
</p>
<p>
The Interactive Monthly Administrative Checklist is a dynamic tool designed to help you efficiently manage your administrative tasks. 
This feature provides a comprehensive, easy-to-use checklist that updates monthly, ensuring you stay on top of your responsibilities 
throughout the academic year. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Key Benefits</b>
<ol>
  <li><b>Streamlined Task Management:</b> Easily track your to-do list with a clear, organized layout that prioritizes your administrative duties.</li>
  <li><b>Monthly Updates:</b> Receive timely updates and reminders tailored to the specific needs of each month, keeping you ahead of schedule.</li>
  <li><b>Collaboration:</b> Mark tasks as completed and assign team members to different tasks to promote collaboration and ensure everyone is aligned on key administrative tasks.</li>
</ol>
<b>How to Access</b>
<p>
When you <a href="https://my.wildflowerschools.org/login" target="_blank">sign in</a>, you will see the option to go to “checklists” on the left hand side. 
From there you will see a list of tasks and milestones that match the monthly admin checklists. We encourage you to take a look, explore around and 
start assigning yourself and your partner tasks to track your monthly to-do list!
</p>

<b>Inviting Your Partner Teacher Leader</b>
<p>
If your partner Teacher Leader isn’t listed on the school profile, you can invite them directly to the platform by following these steps:
  <ol>
    <li>Click on “View School Profile”</li>
    <li>Click on “Edit School Profile”</li>
    <li>Navigate to the “Teacher Leader” tab</li>
    <li>Add a teacher leader already in the network or invite them to join</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  Note: If you invite a teacher, they need to accept the invitation and create their account before you'll be able to assign them tasks.
</p>
<br/>
<b>Office Hours and Support</b>
<p>
We will be hosting office hours and an evening session over the next few weeks focusing on learning how to use the new Admin checklists. Please join if you can!
